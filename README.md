# INFO-F422_SFML - Classification & Regression ML Algorithms

This repository contains two self-contained jupyter notebooks:
1. A classification notebook that contains an implementation, analysis and comparisson of multiple ML classification algorithms in real-world datasets and synthetic datasets.
2. A regression notebook that contains an implementation, analysis and comparisson of multiple ML regression algorithms in real-world datasets and synthetic datasets.

## Usage

1. Clone the repo.
2. Create and activate a virtualenv under the env/ directory.
3. Install the requirements using pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Run Jupyter in whatever way works for you. The simplest would be to run pip install jupyter && jupyter notebook.
